                        <p>Born in Turku, currently living in Naantali with my Wife and two cats. I'm few months away 26 years old. I'm into programming, hiking, and playing guitar.

My job description consists from different roles of a retail sales person of which warehouse worker has been my absolute favorite. As a warehouse worker I've had the chance to utilize my best assets: good time management, logical thinking, stress tolerance and skill to work as an individual in a team. As a committed, passionated and creative student I believe I have a lot to offer for you. I'm open to tell more about myself in person.</p>

                            <h4>Python</h4>

                            <p>The first programming language I learned. During my first year of studies I learned the basics of Python and did some basic functions.{"\n"}On the first semester of second year studies I learned Python back-end programming. Course application was done in virtual machine with pgAdmin 4, Flask, and Postman.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Java</h4>
                            <p>I learned Java on my spare time along with my second semester first year studies. I needed to learn it in short period to develop an android based application with my team members during product development course. My role was to be the chairman{"\n"}Our team succeeded to develop an Android based attendance application which accomplished a shared first place as the best product in a competition within the course.{"\n"}Naturally, we were and still are very proud of this achievement. We used Java as programming language, Android Studio as development platform, and Google's Firebase as database.{"\n\n"}</p>
                            <p>In the summer of 2020 I continued to refine my skills on developing android application and programmed my own app, Frisbeeh.{"\n"}Goal was to learn more and refine my skills, this time on my own.{"\n\n"}In similar fashion I used Java, Android Studio, and Firebase database, but added new content such as working login & sign up options.{"\n\n"}</p>

                            <h4>HTML, CSS & JavaScript</h4>
                            <p>Before early fall of 2020 I had no experience on web development, only a deep drive to learn and master it.{"\n"}I watched many tutorials and along them began my trial & error type of learning process.{"\n"}I've grown very passionated about web development and will continue to refine my knowledge on it in future.{"\n\n"}</p>
